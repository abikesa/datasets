1. Syntax:: Deep
   - Subject
   - Verb
   - Object

2. Transformation
     
   - Chomsky's theory of `transformational-generative` grammar involves the idea of transforming a deep structure into a surface structure through various transformations. Here are some types of transformations in Chomskyan syntax:
   - Also, [Michel Foucault](https://chomsky.info/1971xxxx/) is subsummed here since verbs could be active or passive, implying hierarchy and power or lack thereof

   1. **Passivization:**
      - Example: "The cat chased the mouse" (active) transforms into "The mouse was chased by the cat" (passive).

   2. **Clefting:**
      - Example: "I saw the movie last night" transforms into "It was the movie that I saw last night."

   3. **Question Formation:**
      - Example: "She is reading a book" transforms into "Is she reading a book?"

   4. **Movement:**
      - Involves moving constituents from one position in a sentence to another.
      - Example: "John will give a book to Mary" transforms into "To Mary, John will give a book."

   5. **Extraposition:**
      - Involves moving constituents to the end of a sentence.
      - Example: "I believe that the world is round" transforms into "I believe the world is round."

   6. **Conjunction Reduction:**
      - Example: "John likes coffee, and Mary likes tea" transforms into "John likes coffee, Mary tea."

   7. **Relative Clause Formation:**
      - Example: "The man who is sitting over there is my friend" transforms into "The man sitting over there is my friend."

   8. **Equi-NP Deletion:**
      - Example: "John likes coffee, and Bill does too" transforms into "John likes coffee, and Bill does."

   These transformations play a crucial role in Chomsky's theory of syntax, allowing for the generation of a wide variety of sentences from a relatively small set of underlying structures. Keep in mind that the list is not exhaustive, and there are more transformations and variations within Chomsky's framework.

3. Metaphor
   - Increased ambiguity
   - Recipient can project their affect onto this ambiguity
   - Here `meaning` become `participatory`
