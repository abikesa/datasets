1. Confounder vs. Metaphor
   - Bernstein calls this the X-factor
   - Prose make it explicity
   - Simile does to
   - But metaphor dispenses with it
   - And hereby art and aesthetics are born
   - Ambiguity is introduced
   - `Meaning` is mystefied
   - [Semantics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IxJbc_aMTg&t=2205s) as mode of inquiry makes entrace
   - In music this X-factor can be intrinsic, extrinsic, or analogous
   - We'll focus on the intrinct X-factors (motivs, chords, rhythms)
   - These "link" nouns/subjects/agents to each other
   - But assocication is not causation
   - Human error has its core here and this is the powerful force that unites us to artists & celebrities
   - Its affective, emotional, powerful, especially for those with little agency
   - An inner wish, control, magic, that X-factor, though it holds `nothing` of the causal power in reality
   - Thus `meta`
